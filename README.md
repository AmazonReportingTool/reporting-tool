<b>Dashboard:</b>

Shows 4 vital informatics to the user upon first logging in.  A small view of the SKU/Brand report, Revenue during the time period saved to the user profile, Inventory (not accurate / functioning), and Return Rate (not accurate / functioning).
	
Also note the threshold and time frame input fields near the top of the view.  This saves the time frame to the user's profile in the database.  All data displayed from this point forward will be from the time frame which the user has specified and saved to his profile.

To run the project locally one should clone the repository and run the following commands (with node js and all appropriate mean stack utilities installed)

<br /> 
npm install<br /> 
npm install mws-sdk<br /> 
bower update<br /> 
grunt<br /> <br /> 

<b> It is crucial that the user store their credentials in a local.js file located in the /config/env/ directory.</b>
The program does not currently take credentials from the database but a local js file because up until this point the product was developed for in-house use (see note about not having actual deployment).
